"""Caracara batching support.

This module contains all the required code to generically parallelise retrieval of data batches.

The endpoints handled here typically look for a list of IDs in the body
and return back a dictionary of data.

For paginated results that send back IDs, the pagination code file contains
the required code to pull this data down as quickly as possible.
